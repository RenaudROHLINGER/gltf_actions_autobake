# Blender Addon for GLTF

### Installation
download this repo, then install it through to Blender Preferences > Add-ons -> Install

### Usage
***Before exporting anything it's recommend to save your blender file as the export system will use the name of your file for the exports.***

### Bake Camera
It's recommend to have only 1 camera as the script will pick the first available camera. It will then export a glb file containing only the camera and its action baked : blenderfilename_camera.glb
